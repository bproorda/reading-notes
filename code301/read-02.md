# JQuery and the Dom

**JQuery**
- way to simply your js using jQuery library
- uses css-style selectors
- intiate with `$('selector')`, creates jquery object
- act upon JQuery object using methods, such as `$('li.hot').addClass('complete');`
- add JQuery in HTML file using script src
- Why use JQuery?
  - using CSS selectors is faster and often more accurate
  - can do the same steps as DOM, but in fewer lines of code
  - cross-browser compatability
- *A matched set*
   - if selector used selected multiple elements, it is a matched set.
   - items put into list
   - if a method is used to *get* information from the matched set, it will pull that information from the first item in the set.
     - use transverse, or filter to pick out other elements, use each to get info from all the elements.
   - if a method is used to *set* information, it will set for all the elements.
- when you create a JQuery object, it creates a reference to that node, not a copy.
  - it is better to reuse the same JQ object than to recreate it when needed
- you use several methods in the same line `$('li.hot').hide().delay(500).fadeIn(1400);`
- `$(document).ready(function(){ //code block only runs after page had loaded});`
- `$(function() { same as the above, but shorter });`
- *creating new elements with JQ*
   - 1. Create new element in a JQ object
        - `var $newltem = $('<li class="new">item</ li>');`
   - 2. Attach to DOM
        - use before, after, append, prepend
- getting/setting values
  - some methods: attr, removeAttr, addClass, removeClass
- getting/setting css properties
  - to get a css property, use the property name `$( ' li ' ) .css('background-color' );`
  - to set a css `$('li ') .css('background-color' , '1272727' )` separate with comma, not colon
  - to set multiple properties use object notation: `$('li ').css({ ' background-col or' : ' #272727' , ' font-family' : 'Courier'});  
- JQ can recreate functionality of loops
  - each: performs method/function onto each item in selection
  - this: use this for each "iteration" to select the current item
- *Event Handling*
   - the .on() method handles all events: $(li).on('click', function...);
   - first parameter is event, second is the code you want to run when event fires
   - event object methods: type, which, data, target, pageX, pageY, .preventDefault, .stopPropagation
