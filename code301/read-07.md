# REST
really not sure what to wrote about the conversation, but I will try...

REST, REpresentaional State Transfer is, is an architectural style for providing standars between computer systems. More simply, it is trying to define a way for machines/computers to talk each other. It defines resources as concepts, and web pages are represtentations of the resources. 
A URL is basically of refernce or address of where a user or machine can find that page. Machines do not really have nouns or verbs to communicate the same way humans do, yet. This can make communication difficult. So the machine has to define the noun, then it generally has four verbs it can use. 
get - retreive a specific resource(s)
post - create a new resource
put - update a specific resource
delete - remove a specific
