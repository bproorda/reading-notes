# Normalization
- Normalization: reducing redundancies and dependency.
- meant to elimante unnecessary data, and making sure the data is logicallly.
- catergorized by several normalized forms, even still developing more
- 1NF
  - each cell contains a single, atomic, value
  - each record is unique
- a *key* is value used to identify a record in a table uniquely
- a *primary key* cannot be null, must be unique, and given a value when a new record is entered
- a *composite key* is a primary key composed of multiple columns used to identify a record uniquely
- 2NF
  - same as 1NF and:
  - Single Column Primary Key
- Data can also be seperated to multiple tables. IE one for (A) memberships information, another for (B) member rental data
- a *foreign key* is a reference to a primary key in another table, member # is primary in table A, foreign in B
  - foreign keys do not have to be unique
- transitive functional dependency is when changing a non-key column, might cause any of the other non-key columns to change
  - data on col 5 depends on col 3, if col 5 changes col 3 has to as well
- 3NF
  - same as 2nf and:
  - Has no transitive functional dependencies
