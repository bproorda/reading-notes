# Unit Testing
- Breaking down your code to test for proper behavior and functionality
- the discrete segment of code being tested is called a unit.
- built into your code, use VS or third party programs
- Think of it as using the scientific method:  hypothesize and test
- Unit testing version: arrange, act, assert
  - arrange all the code needed for the test
  - act: invoke the test method
  - assert: use the assert class
- Good general practice is have one asset method per test, test one thing at at time.
- xunit allows fact or theory tests
  - Facts are tests which are always true. They test invariant conditions.
  - Theories are tests which are only true for a particular set of data
