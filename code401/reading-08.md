# LINQ
- Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is the name for a set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language
- With LINQ, a query is a first-class language construct, just like classes, methods, events. You write queries against strongly typed collections of objects by using language keywords and familiar operators.
- Query expressions are written in a declarative query syntax.
- A query is an expression that retrieves data from a data source.
- three actions
  - obtain data source
  - createt the query
  - execute the query
- one example: if datasource is a array, it implicity supports IEnumberable interface
- a query is executed in foreach and requires I#numberable
- The query specifies what information to retrieve from the data source or sources
